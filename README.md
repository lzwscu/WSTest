Deep Neural Networks for Python

This is just a wrapper of the PyBrain library to support layerwise pretraining for deep nets.
I made this for a quick, one-time use. There are better implementations available. I recommend:
* [DeepPy](https://github.com/andersbll/deeppy)
* [scikit-neuralnetwork](https://github.com/aigamedev/scikit-neuralnetwork)

But if you want a very simple, single-class solution, try it out:

## Setup
1. Make sure that [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org/) is installed.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Then import the network class `from DNN.dnn import AutoEncoder`
